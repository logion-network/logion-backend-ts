| Dear #{walletUser.firstName} #{walletUser.lastName},
|
| You receive this message because you are requesting a recovery action from a Legal Officer through the logion blockchain network.
| Please note, you can't answer this email. logion will never ask you to provide any kind of information or let you access to a web address through its email notifications.
|
| One of your Legal Officers, #{legalOfficer.userIdentity.firstName} #{legalOfficer.userIdentity.lastName}, has accepted to let you recover all digital assets from your Polkadot account set as follows: #{protection.requesterAddress}.

include /legal-officer-details.pug

|
| Upon acceptance of both selected Legal Officers, you will be able, from the "Recovery" section of your wallet, to:
| * activate the protection of your new account
| * recover all digital assets from your previous account (#{protection.addressToRecover}) by transfering them to the new one
